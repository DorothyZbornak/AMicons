Place these files in:
/Username/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Emoticons/

Then go to your Adium preferences and find your new sets in the Emoticons drop down in the Appearance pane.

You will have to restart Adium to see them.

If you prefer to have git manage this for you and not have to download zips.

1. go to the above folder and move any of your personal emoticon packs that are NOT amicons to another folder 
2. delete the Emoticons folder
3. using the github application, clone the repo as "Emoticons" instead of amicons this will make the base of the repo the Emoticons folder. 
4. move your other emoticon packs back into place. They are being ignored using the previously committed .gitingnore file!
